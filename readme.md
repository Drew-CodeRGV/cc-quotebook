##To Begin: 
-Check the requirements.txt file to make sure you have what you need (other than Python, obvsly)
-Download the file compile_sheets.py

##To Run:
Now, let's say you have all the original xlsx files in a folder called 'Data'
you can run the script with:

```
python compile_sheets.py -o master.xlsx data/*
```

That will generate a file called master.xlsx that has all the info.
